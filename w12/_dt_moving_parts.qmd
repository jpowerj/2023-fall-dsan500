## Two "Moving Parts"

Two ways to obtain new datasets (and hence new decision trees):

::: {layout="[1,1]"}

::: {#moving-parts-left}

<center>
**Dropping Columns:**
</center>

:::
::: {#moving-parts-right}

<center>
**Dropping Rows:**
</center>

* We could obtain new datasets by **dropping/resampling rows**
