The Quarto extension should be the first result:\n\n![](images/quarto-extension.jpeg)\n\nOnce you have this extension installed, there is a bit of a typo in the assignment description about how to create a Quarto **project** (specifically, a **website** project) within VSCode.\n\nRather than using VS-Code->New file->\"Quarto project\", in the most recent version of the Quarto extension you should instead do the following:\n\n1. Use the keyboard shortcut {{< kbd Shift-Cmd-P >}} ({{< kbd Shift-Ctrl-P >}} on Windows) to open what's called the **Command Palette** in VSCode. It is a box with a text field in it that should pop up near the top of your screen:\n\n![](images/command-palette.jpeg)\n\n2. Within this Command Palette, start typing the word \"Quarto\". As you type, it should filter out the irrelevant commands and just show the **Quarto-related** commands.\n3. The first command in the list should now be **Quarto: Create Project**:\n\n![](images/create-project.jpeg)\n\n4. Click this command, to begin the process of creating a Quarto project\n5. Choose \"Quarto Website\" on the next screen:\n\n![](images/website-project.jpeg)\n\n6. Choose the folder on your computer where you would like Quarto to create the website (for the lab, for example, you could create a folder called `simple_quarto_website`, and tell Quarto that you'd like to create the website within that folder):\n\n![](images/choose-directory.jpeg)\n\n7. VSCode will now create the website and display the created files \"_quarto.yml\", \"index.qmd\", \"about.qmd\", and \"style.css\" in the \"Explorer\" pane on the left side of the VSCode interface:\n\n![](images/quarto-website-vscode.jpeg)\n\nYou should now be able to proceed with the lab, by modifying and adding files to this newly-created Quarto website project.\n\n::: {#quarto-doesnt-appear .callout-note title=\"If \\\"Quarto: Create Project\\\" Does Not Appear\"}\n\nSome students are experiencing a bug where the \"Quarto: Create Project\" option does not appear in their Command Palette, after pressing {{< kbd Cmd+Shift+P >}}. In this case, no need to worry: just create a new folder (called `simple_quarto_website`, for example), and within this folder you'll need to create four files, which are the same four files that the \"Quarto: Create Project\" command creates:\n\n### 1. `_quarto.yml`\n\nCreate a file called `_quarto.yml` with the following contents:\n\n```yaml {filename=\"_quarto.yml\"}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"simple_quarto_website\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n```\n\n### 2. `styles.css`\n\nThen create a file called `styles.css` that can be empty for now.\n\n### 3. `index.qmd`\n\nThis file should have the following contents:\n\n```md\n---\ntitle: \"simple_quarto_website\"\n---\n\nThis is a Quarto website.\n\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.\n```\n\n### 4. `about.qmd`\n\nThis file should have the following contents:\n\n```md\n---\ntitle: \"About\"\n---\n\nAbout this site\n\n```\n\nThese are the default website contents that the \"Quarto: New Project\" command creates in this `_quarto.yml` file, so for the most part you should be ready to work on the rest of the project even if this command did not appear when you typed \"Quarto\" into the Command Palette.\n\n:::\n\n### Multiple Versions of the About Page\n\nThere is a step in Component-3 which asks you to:\n\n* Convert `about.qmd` to `about.ipynb` with `quarto convert about.qmd`.\n\nAfter which (the last bullet in the section) it also asks you to\n\n* modify `_quarto.yml` accordingly `- about.qmd` -> `about.ipynb`\n\nPlease note the following points about these two steps:\n\n### Making sure you have added both `href` and `text` data when updating `_quarto.yml`\n\n* When you go to modify `_quarto.yml`, you'll notice that the **Home** link is specified using two pieces of information, `href` and `text`:\n\n```\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n```\n\n* However, the **About** link is specified using a single bullet point, just indicating the name of the file:\n\n```\n      - about.qmd\n```\n\n* So, when you go to update `_quarto.yml` to change `about.qmd` to `about.ipynb`, make sure that you include **both** pieces of information given for the **Home** link, so that your new link information should now be:\n\n```\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - href: about.ipynb\n        text: About\n```\n\n### Specifying the output format for `about.ipynb`\n\n* After running `quarto convert about.qmd`, you can open the generated `about.ipynb` file to view the result.\n* However, you'll see that the **metadata block** at the top of the file (the block which starts and ends with `---`) only contains the `title` attribute. That is, the top of the file will look like the following:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"About\"\n---\n```\n\n* But, for your website to correctly render this `.ipynb` file, you'll need to also add information to this metadata block telling Quarto that you'd like it to output **HTML code** when it renders `about.ipynb` for your website.\n* To achieve this, add an additional line within the metadata block (i.e., between the starting `---` and the ending `---`), after the `title: \"About\"` line, specifying `format: html`. If you've done this correctly, your metadata block will now look like the following:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: \"About\"\nformat: html\n---\n```\n\n* Once you have added this additional piece of metadata, and saved your changes to the `about.ipynb` file, you will be halfway to successfully rendering this file as a page within your website. For the second half, see the next point.\n\n### Removing the `about.qmd` file\n\n* If you try to `quarto render` and/or `quarto preview` the website now, you may find that clicking the \"About\" link at the top of the page will show just the raw text content of the `about.ipynb` file, rather than the **rendered**, nicely-formatted and human-readable version. That is, when you click the \"About\" link, you may just see a plaintext file with the following contents:\n\n```\n{\n  \"cells\": [\n    {\n      \"cell_type\": \"raw\",\n      \"metadata\": {},\n      \"source\": [\n        \"---\\n\",\n        \"title: \\\"About\\\"\\n\",\n        \"format: html\\n\",\n        \"---\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n      \"metadata\": {},\n      \"source\": [\n        \"About this site\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"kernelspec\": {\n      \"display_name\": \"Python 3 (ipykernel)\",\n      \"language\": \"python\",\n      \"name\": \"python3\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"nbformat\": 4,\n  \"nbformat_minor\": 4\n}\n```\n\n* If you encounter this issue, you can fix it by resolving the ambiguity that Quarto faces in having both `about.qmd` and `about.ipynb` files, and not knowing which one to choose as the file that should be rendered to create the final `about.html` file, the file that will be placed in the `_site` directory that `quarto render` creates.\n* To resolve this ambiguity,\n  * First, if you're paranoid about losing the information in `about.qmd`, you can back this file up to another folder on your computer.\n  * Then (or, you can start here if you're not worried about losing `about.qmd`), delete the original `about.qmd` file.\n* Deleting the original `about.qmd` file will thus ensure that Quarto has a single `about` file (in this case, `about.ipynb`) that it knows is the file you want Quarto to render and show when a user clicks the \"About\" link.\n\n## Component-4 and Component-5: Lorem Ipsum Text\n\nIn one of the bullets in both the Component-4 section and Component-5 section of the lab, it mentions the following:\n\n* **Note**: Use of `ipsum lorem` place-holder text is allowed\n\nWhat this means is just: If you would like \"filler text\" for your `index.qmd` page, to show what it will look like once it's filled with content (but without having to write hundreds of words of content yourself), you can use a [\"Lorem Ipsum text generator\"](https://loremipsum.io/){target=\"_blank\"} to auto-generate some number of paragraphs (filled with random Latin words), and place this auto-generated text in your `index.qmd` file.\n\nTo see why you might want to do this, consider the difference between the following structure with no filler text:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Section Headers *Without* Filler Content\" appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n### My Heading\n\n#### My Subheading\n\n#### Another Subheading\n\n#### Third Subheading\n\n:::\n\nAnd the same structure but \"filled out\" with paragraphs of randomly-generated text:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Section Headers *With* Filler Content\" appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n### My Heading\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Create a `slides` subfolder, within `simple_quarto_website`\n2. Create a file within the `slides` subfolder called `slides.ipynb`\n\nAnd then it asks you to modify the `yaml`-format metadata block---this is the block of specially-formatted key-value pairs at the **top** of the **first cell** within the `slides.ipynb` file, that looks like the following (for example):\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My Slideshow\"\n---\n```\n\nTo specify to **Quarto** that you'd like it to **render** this `slides.ipynb` file specifically as a **Reveal.js slideshow**, you'll need to add the following additional key-value pair to this metadata block (which, again, should be at the top of the first cell within `slides.ipynb`):\n\n```yaml\nformat: revealjs\n```\n\nMeaning that, if your original metadata block just had the title, like in the example above, now it will have two pieces of information for Quarto:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My Slideshow\"\nformat: revealjs\n---\n```\n\nOnce you've specified this format, though, it is still a bit tricky to **preview** the slideshow (to make sure that modifications you make are actually appearing in the slideshow, for example), since the Quarto extension for VSCode does **not** provide a nice \"Render\" button for `.ipynb`-format files like it does for `.qmd`-format files.\n\nSo, you can make your life slightly easier by **adding a link to the slideshow** from your website's **main** navigation bar. To do that, you'll need to modify your website's `_quarto.yml` file, which contains the global settings for the website. If you open this file at this point in the project, it should look something like:\n\n```yml {filename=\"_quarto.yml\"}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"simple_quarto_website\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.ipynb\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n```\n\nNotice the portion within the value of `website` (the indented portions under `website:`) with the key `navbar`, and within that value, the key `left`. Every bullet point underneath this `left` key will correspond to a **link** on the **top navbar** of your website, where the `left` key indicates that these links will be **left-aligned** (you could add a new key `right:`, and some links underneath that key, and those links would be right-aligned on the top navbar).\n\nSo, to add a link to the slideshow you are creating in `slides/slides.ipynb`, we'll need to modify two things in this `_quarto.yml` file. First, since Quarto will sometimes complain and/or get confused if some links have `href` and `text` tags while others do not have this tag, let's change the link that just contains `about.ipynb` to have an `href` and `label`, like:\n\n```yaml\n- href: about.ipynb\n  text: About\n```\n\nThe YAML format requires that elements of a list (like the list of left-aligned links under the `left` key) line up in terms of indentation, so make sure that the full `_quarto.yml` file now looks something like:\n\n```yml {filename=\"_quarto.yml\"}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"simple_quarto_website\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - href: about.ipynb\n        text: About\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n```\n\nNow we should be able to add another, third link to this list, allowing us to go directly to the slideshow we're making in `slides/slides.ipynb`. To do this, add a new element to the `left` list by adding another \"bullet point\" (another `-` character), then set the `href` value to be exactly that path (`slides/slides.ipynb`) and the `text` value to be \"My Slides\" (or, any title you'd like). Your `_quarto.yml` file should now look something like:\n\n```yml {filename=\"_quarto.yml\"}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"simple_quarto_website\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - href: about.ipynb\n        text: About\n      - href: slides/slides.ipynb\n        text: Slides\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n```\n\nand now when you **preview your website** by running the `quarto preview` command in the **terminal** (from within the root directory of your website, which should be named `simple_quarto_website`), you should see three links in the top navbar: one to \"Home\", one to the \"About\" page, and a third to \"Slides\".\n\nNow, when you actually **click** the \"Slides\" link, it may not show anything, or it may show a bunch of non-human-readable raw code (which is actually the `.json` structure underlying a `.ipynb` file). This, however, is a separate issue, that you'll need to tackle: how to get Quarto to know that it should show the **Reveal.js presentation** as the **rendered form** of the `slides/slides.ipynb` file. And that is part of the challenge of the assignment. As a hint, though, you should break it down into steps, to check exactly **where** this rendering is going wrong (if the slideshow doesn't render as intended when you click the new \"Slides\" link):\n\n1. If you run the `quarto preview` command from **within** the `slides` folder (rather than the **root** folder of your website, `simple_quarto_website`), does it display correctly as a slideshow?\n2. Is the **first cell** in your `slides.ipynb` file in the correct format for containing file metadata? (File metadata can only be entered in \"raw\" or \"markdown\" cell types. If the first cell is, for example, a \"Python\" cell type, Quarto will be unable to read your metadata block, as it will think it's Python code rather than YAML code).\n3. Does the **file metadata** actually **exist in a block** at the top of the first cell? As mentioned above, the top of the first cell in your `.ipynb` file (which should be a \"raw\" or \"markdown\" type cell) should look something like\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Slides\"\nformat: revealjs\n---\n```\n\nIf you don't see text that looks like this at the top of the first cell in your `slides.ipynb` file, please add it and try to preview the file again (both from the root folder of your website and, for debugging purposes, also from the `slides` subfolder, as mentioned in step #1 above)\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Links\"}\n\n[Lab 1.2 Link](https://jfh.georgetown.domains/dsan5000/slides-and-labs/_site/content/labs/assignments/lab-1.2/assignment.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n:::\n\n## Component-3\n\n### Creating a Quarto Website in VSCode\n\nThe beginning of the Component-3 description states that you should:\n\n* Make sure the Quarto extension is installed in VS-Code.\n* Using VS-Code –> New file –> “Quarto project” –> create a blank Quarto “Website” project in your 5000-lab-1.2 repo call simple_quarto_website\n\nTo clarify this portion: you can install the Quarto extension for VSCode by clicking on the \"Extensions\" panel on the left side of the VSCode interface (or pressing `Cmd`+`Shift`+`X`) and searching for \"Quarto\" in the extensions search box.

That is, when you click the \"About\" link, you may just see a plaintext file with the following contents:\n\n```\n{\n  \"cells\": [\n    {\n      \"cell_type\": \"raw\",\n      \"metadata\": {},\n      \"source\": [\n        \"---\\n\",\n        \"title: \\\"About\\\"\\n\",\n        \"format: html\\n\",\n        \"---\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n      \"metadata\": {},\n      \"source\": [\n        \"About this site\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"kernelspec\": {\n      \"display_name\": \"Python 3 (ipykernel)\",\n      \"language\": \"python\",\n      \"name\": \"python3\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"nbformat\": 4,\n  \"nbformat_minor\": 4\n}\n```\n\n* If you encounter this issue, you can fix it by resolving the ambiguity that Quarto faces in having both `about.qmd` and `about.ipynb` files, and not knowing which one to choose as the file that should be rendered to create the final `about.html` file, the file that will be placed in the `_site` directory that `quarto render` creates.\n* To resolve this ambiguity,\n  * First, if you're paranoid about losing the information in `about.qmd`, you can back this file up to another folder on your computer.\n  * Then (or, you can start here if you're not worried about losing `about.qmd`), delete the original `about.qmd` file.\n* Deleting the original `about.qmd` file will thus ensure that Quarto has a single `about` file (in this case, `about.ipynb`) that it knows is the file you want Quarto to render and show when a user clicks the \"About\" link.\n\n## Component-4 and Component-5: Lorem Ipsum Text\n\nIn one of the bullets in both the Component-4 section and Component-5 section of the lab, it mentions the following:\n\n* **Note**: Use of `ipsum lorem` place-holder text is allowed\n\nWhat this means is just: If you would like \"filler text\" for your `index.qmd` page, to show what it will look like once it's filled with content (but without having to write hundreds of words of content yourself), you can use a [\"Lorem Ipsum text generator\"](https://loremipsum.io/){target=\"_blank\"} to auto-generate some number of paragraphs (filled with random Latin words), and place this auto-generated text in your `index.qmd` file.\n\nTo see why you might want to do this, consider the difference between the following structure with no filler text:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Section Headers *Without* Filler Content\" appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n### My Heading\n\n#### My Subheading\n\n#### Another Subheading\n\n#### Third Subheading\n\n:::\n\nAnd the same structure but \"filled out\" with paragraphs of randomly-generated text:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Section Headers *With* Filler Content\" appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n### My Heading\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Create a `slides` subfolder, within `simple_quarto_website`\n2. Create a file within the `slides` subfolder called `slides.ipynb`\n\nAnd then it asks you to modify the `yaml`-format metadata block---this is the block of specially-formatted key-value pairs at the **top** of the **first cell** within the `slides.ipynb` file, that looks like the following (for example):\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My Slideshow\"\n---\n```\n\nTo specify to **Quarto** that you'd like it to **render** this `slides.ipynb` file specifically as a **Reveal.js slideshow**, you'll need to add the following additional key-value pair to this metadata block (which, again, should be at the top of the first cell within `slides.ipynb`):\n\n```yaml\nformat: revealjs\n```\n\nMeaning that, if your original metadata block just had the title, like in the example above, now it will have two pieces of information for Quarto:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"My Slideshow\"\nformat: revealjs\n---\n```\n\nOnce you've specified this format, though, it is still a bit tricky to **preview** the slideshow (to make sure that modifications you make are actually appearing in the slideshow, for example), since the Quarto extension for VSCode does **not** provide a nice \"Render\" button for `.ipynb`-format files like it does for `.qmd`-format files.\n\nSo, you can make your life slightly easier by **adding a link to the slideshow** from your website's **main** navigation bar. To do that, you'll need to modify your website's `_quarto.yml` file, which contains the global settings for the website. If you open this file at this point in the project, it should look something like:\n\n```yml {filename=\"_quarto.yml\"}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"simple_quarto_website\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.ipynb\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n```\n\nNotice the portion within the value of `website` (the indented portions under `website:`) with the key `navbar`, and within that value, the key `left`. Every bullet point underneath this `left` key will correspond to a **link** on the **top navbar** of your website, where the `left` key indicates that these links will be **left-aligned** (you could add a new key `right:`, and some links underneath that key, and those links would be right-aligned on the top navbar).\n\nSo, to add a link to the slideshow you are creating in `slides/slides.ipynb`, we'll need to modify two things in this `_quarto.yml` file. First, since Quarto will sometimes complain and/or get confused if some links have `href` and `text` tags while others do not have this tag, let's change the link that just contains `about.ipynb` to have an `href` and `label`, like:\n\n```yaml\n- href: about.ipynb\n  text: About\n```\n\nThe YAML format requires that elements of a list (like the list of left-aligned links under the `left` key) line up in terms of indentation, so make sure that the full `_quarto.yml` file now looks something like:\n\n```yml {filename=\"_quarto.yml\"}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"simple_quarto_website\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - href: about.ipynb\n        text: About\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n```\n\nNow we should be able to add another, third link to this list, allowing us to go directly to the slideshow we're making in `slides/slides.ipynb`. To do this, add a new element to the `left` list by adding another \"bullet point\" (another `-` character), then set the `href` value to be exactly that path (`slides/slides.ipynb`) and the `text` value to be \"My Slides\" (or, any title you'd like). Your `_quarto.yml` file should now look something like:\n\n```yml {filename=\"_quarto.yml\"}\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"simple_quarto_website\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - href: about.ipynb\n        text: About\n      - href: slides/slides.ipynb\n        text: Slides\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\n```\n\nand now when you **preview your website** by running the `quarto preview` command in the **terminal** (from within the root directory of your website, which should be named `simple_quarto_website`), you should see three links in the top navbar: one to \"Home\", one to the \"About\" page, and a third to \"Slides\".\n\nNow, when you actually **click** the \"Slides\" link, it may not show anything, or it may show a bunch of non-human-readable raw code (which is actually the `.json` structure underlying a `.ipynb` file). This, however, is a separate issue, that you'll need to tackle: how to get Quarto to know that it should show the **Reveal.js presentation** as the **rendered form** of the `slides/slides.ipynb` file. And that is part of the challenge of the assignment. As a hint, though, you should break it down into steps, to check exactly **where** this rendering is going wrong (if the slideshow doesn't render as intended when you click the new \"Slides\" link):\n\n1. If you run the `quarto preview` command from **within** the `slides` folder (rather than the **root** folder of your website, `simple_quarto_website`), does it display correctly as a slideshow?\n2. Is the **first cell** in your `slides.ipynb` file in the correct format for containing file metadata? (File metadata can only be entered in \"raw\" or \"markdown\" cell types. If the first cell is, for example, a \"Python\" cell type, Quarto will be unable to read your metadata block, as it will think it's Python code rather than YAML code).\n3. Does the **file metadata** actually **exist in a block** at the top of the first cell? As mentioned above, the top of the first cell in your `.ipynb` file (which should be a \"raw\" or \"markdown\" type cell) should look something like\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Slides\"\nformat: revealjs\n---\n```\n\nIf you don't see text that looks like this at the top of the first cell in your `slides.ipynb` file, please add it and try to preview the file again (both from the root folder of your website and, for debugging purposes, also from the `slides` subfolder, as mentioned in step #1 above)\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"include-in-header":{"text":"<script
