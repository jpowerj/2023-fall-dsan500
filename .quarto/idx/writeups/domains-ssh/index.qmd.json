If you haven't already done so, or you're having trouble setting one up, please feel free to <a href=\"mailto:jj1088@georgetown.edu\" target=\"_blank\">email me</a>.\n\n\nTo remotely access your Georgetown Domains server from your local computer (outside of the method we used before, of accessing the terminal through a web interface), you will first need to **create an SSH keypair**, which you can think of in two steps:\n\n1. Georgetown Domains generates a \"keyhole\" on your Domains server, a **Public Key**, which allows your Domains server to be accessed remotely by someone who has the matching **private key**. Hence, it also creates a\n2. **Private Key**: a file (in this case, it will be called `id_rsa`, with no file extension) that you save onto your computer, and you **remember where you saved it**, that will allow you to access your Georgetown Domains server remotely. There is a third piece of information here, which is the **passphrase** that will **protect** your private key from unauthorized usage (this is required by Georgetown, but is optional in general), but we'll worry about that in a moment.\n\nLet's generate this keypair step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1.1: Opening the \"SSH Access\" Tool in Georgetown Domains\n\nOpen your browser and navigate to the **Georgetown Domains dashboard**. This is the interface that opens if you navigate to [https://georgetown.domains/dashboard](https://georgetown.domains/dashboard){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nIf you scroll down to the category of tools with the heading \"Security\", you will see an icon and a link for \"SSH Access\":\n\n![](images/ssh_access.jpeg)\n\nClick this link to open the SSH key generation page, and then once this page opens, click the \"Manage SSH Keys\" button:\n\n![](images/manage_keys.jpeg)\n\n### Step 1.2: Generating the Key\n\nAfter clicking \"Manage SSH Keys\" and waiting for the next page to load, don't worry about any of the other options, just click the \"+ Generate a New Key\" button near the top:\n\n![](images/generate_new_key_button.jpeg)\n\nWithin the key-generation form that appears, you don't need to enter or modify anything **except for the Key Password and Reenter Password fields**. The way these two fields are phrased is a bit confusing, since you already have a **password** to access Georgetown services in general (as in, the password that you use to log into Canvas, for example, that requires Two-Factor Authentication): **do not** enter that password here. This is a **new** password, really called a **passphrase**, and all it does it **protect your SSH private key from unauthorized usage**: if someone manages to steal your `id_rsa` file, they still won't be able to access your Georgetown Domains server without knowing this **passphrase**.\n\n![](images/key_generation_form.jpeg)\n\nSo, choose a passphrase that is easy to remember and passes Georgetown's security requirements (it won't let you submit the form until the passphrase meets those requirements -- you can use the \"Password Generator\" button to auto-generate one if that's easier), and submit the form by clicking the \"Generate Key\" button at the bottom.\n\nIf all went well, you should see a success screen that says \"Key Generation Complete!\" at the top:\n\n![](images/successful_generation.jpeg)\n\nThis screen is also confusing, because it makes it seem like you need to care about the console output that it shows you underneath \"Key Generation Complete!\", but in reality you don't need to worry about it (I excluded it here just in case).\n\n### Step 1.3: Authorizing This Key to Acess Your Server\n\nFrom the \"Key Generation Complete!\" screen, click the \"Go Back\" link at the bottom of the page to return to the SSH Key Generation panel. You should see the window you saw before, with the \"+ Generate a New Key\" button at the top, but now below this button you will also see your newly-created pair of keys: the **public key** just created will now be listed in the \"Public Keys\" list, and then underneath this the **private key** just created will be listed in the \"Private Keys\" list.\n\nThe first, basic step we need to do is verify with Georgetown Domains that the public key is a valid \"keyhole\" for remote computers to use to access your Domains server (you'll notice that it is not authorized by default, so you will see the status \"not authorized\" within the \"Authorization Status\" column of the Public Keys list). To activate it, scroll to the Public Keys list and click the \"Manage\" link (with a wrench icon to the left of it):\n\n![](images/public_keys_list.jpeg)\n\nThis should bring up a screen where you can straightforwardly click the \"Authorize\" button to authorize this public key:\n\n![](images/authorize_public_key.jpeg)\n\nAnd, once you click this, you should see a success message like the following:\n\n![](images/public_key_authorized.jpeg)\n\nClick \"Go Back\" once again to return to the SSH Key Management page.\n\n### Step 1.4: Downloading the Private Key\n\nThat is the last time we'll deal with the public key, the \"keyhole\" to your server, now that it has been authorized for use. Next, scroll further down to the Private Keys listing, where you should see your `id_rsa` private key that we generated in Step 1.2:\n\n![](images/private_keys_listing.jpeg)\n\nIn this case, we **do** want to download this key (as a file) to our local computer, since the `ssh` (and `scp` and `rsync`) command will need to use this key to **acess** your server. So, click the \"View/Download\" button (with a disk icon to the left of it). This will bring you to a scary-looking page, that contains your full private key in a big textbox. You don't need to worry about this, or about the \"Convert to PPK\" section at the bottom of the page. Just scroll to the button which allows you to **download** the key file:\n\n![](images/download_key_button.jpeg)\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Make sure that, once this file has downloaded, you **move it** to a location on your local computer that is **secure** but also **easy to locate**, since you will need to know the **absolute path** to this file, in order to **tell the `ssh` command** where to find it. For example, if I copy the key file to my home directory on a Mac, its path might be:\n\n```\n/Users/jpj/id_rsa\n```\n\nIf you're on Windows, and you move it directly onto your `C:` drive for example, then the path will instead be\n\n```\nC:\\id_rsa\n```\n\nSo, just make sure you **know this absolute path** to the `id_rsa` file, remembering that it **has no file extension**: it's not `id_rsa.txt`, or `id_rsa.pub` (that could be what the public key is called), but just `id_rsa` without extension.\n\n## Step 2: Using the *Private Key* to Access Your Georgetown Domains Server\n\nNow that you have the `id_rsa` file downloaded, in a **location that you can remember the path to** (or write down the path to), open up your **terminal** if you're on Mac or Git Bash if you're on Windows. We'll start by using the `ssh` command, with our private key (`id_rsa`) file, to connect to the server.\n\nThis order is actually somewhat important: we want to start with **`ssh`**, not `scp` or `rsync`, since the syntax for the `scp` and `rsync` commands **build upon** the syntax for the `ssh` command. So, I recommend starting with `ssh`, and working your way towards `scp` and/or `rsync`.\n\nWithin your terminal, we will now \"craft\" a correct `ssh` command (you may actually want to have a text editor open, *next to* your terminal, where you can write out commands to make sure they're correct before copying-and-pasting them into the terminal). The first part is the name of the command, `ssh`. So, right now, you should just have the following written in your terminal (don't press Enter or anything yet, we're going to press Enter once we finish writing out the command!)\n\n```bash\nssh\n```\n\nNow, we need to give to the `ssh` command the following information: (a) that we want to **use a private key to connect**, and (b) the **location** of our private key, in the form of a **path** on your local computer's drive where that key exists.\n\n### Step 2.1: Providing `ssh` the Absolute Path to the Private Key File (`id_rsa`)\n\nTo give the information (a), you add the `-i` flag right after `ssh`, separated by a space. This tells `ssh` that you are about to provide a path to a private key file (again, don't press Enter yet! I will indicate when the command is finished and ready to execute in the terminal):\n\n```bash\nssh -i\n```\n\nNext, we need to provide information (b), the actual **path** to the private key file, which you should include in **double quotes** after the `-i` character (separated by a space). So, for example, if I had moved my private key to `/Users/jpj/id_rsa`, then the command at this point would look like:\n\n```bash\nssh -i \"/Users/jpj/id_rsa\"\n```\n\nIf I was on Windows, and I had saved it directly in the root of my `C:` directory, then the command would instead look like:\n\n```bash\nssh -i \"C:\\id_rsa\"\n```\n\n### Step 2.2: Providing Your Georgetown Domains Username and Domain\n\nNow, there are two final pieces of information that we need to provide to the `ssh` command: (a) our **username** on our Georgetown Domains server, and (b) the **domain** that the Georgetown Domains system has allocated for us. To find both pieces of information, you can navigate back to the Georgetown Domains Dashboard main page: [https://georgetown.domains/dashboard](https://georgetown.domains/dashboard){target=\"_blank\"}, and look for this info box near the top of the page, on the right side of the page:\n\n![](images/gtown_domains_info.jpeg)\n\nThe only information that we need is in the **first two rows** of this info box: in my case, this shows me that:\n\n* My **username** is `jpjgeorg`, and\n* My **domain** is `jpj.georgetown.domains`\n\nThese are exactly the two pieces of information we were looking for! Moving back to the terminal, we can now complete the `ssh` command by entering this information in the form `username@domain`, separated from the end of the private key file path by a space. Using my information, the command is now\n\n```bash\nssh -i \"/path/to/private/key/file\" jpjgeorg@jpj.georgetown.domains\n```\n\n**Keep in mind that this `username@domain` portion may look strange to you**, if your username and your domain are similar/identical. For example, it may have assigned you the username `dsanstudent`, and the domain `dsanstudent.georgetown.domains`: in this case, you need to make sure to include **both pieces of information**: `dsanstudent@dsanstudent.georgetown.domains`. Long story short, the Georgetown Domains system creates a **custom server** just for you, and makes you the **only user** on this custom server, so that information gets repeated in this address: the `dsanstudent.georgetown.domains` server is created, with one user called `dsanstudent`.\n\n### Step 2.3: Running the SSH Command\n\nNow that we understand this, we can **run our command**:\n\n```bash\nssh -i \"/path/to/private/key/file\" username@domain\n```\n\nIf you don't see a scary all-caps error that looks like the following:\n\n```bash\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nPermissions for 'id_rsa' are too open.\nIt is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.\nThis private key will be ignored.\nLoad key \"id_rsa\": bad permissions\nubuntu@192.168.0.1: Permission denied (publickey).\n```\n\nthen you can jump to the next step. However, some students are getting this error. If you see this, you can fix it by doing the following:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Fixing the `INCORRECT PRIVATE KEY PERMISSIONS` Error\"}\n\nIf you see an error that looks like the above, with `WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!` all in caps, this means that when you downloaded you private key from the browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.), it set the permissions on this file to be the \"standard\" permissions for any downloaded file, which is **not** what we want for the private key file, since this is an extremely important file that we want to keep secured. So, we'll have the **change the permissions** on this file to be as secure as possible while still allowing us to use it in the terminal.\n\nSo, open up a **new** terminal window. Using the `cd` command (along with `pwd` to see what your current working directory is), navigate to the location where your `id_rsa` file is stored. Once you have arrived at that path (you can tell by running `ls` and seeing if `id_rsa` is one of the files listed in the directory), you can use the following command to change the permissions on the `id_rsa` file to the required settings for ssh access:\n\n```bash\nchmod 600 id_rsa\n```\n\nThis tells your computer to **change the permissions** of the `id_rsa` file to the permissions code `600`, which corresponds to the case where **you** (the owner) have **read and write** permissions, but **anyone else** has **no** permissions (no read, no write, and no execute) on this file. One you've done this, to make sure it worked, you can check the permissions on the `id_rsa` file specifically by running\n\n```bash\nls -lah id_rsa\n```\n\nThis should print out a detailed listing of information on the `id_rsa` file, and should look like the following if the permissions were set correctly:\n\n```bash\n\n-rw-------@ 1 jpj  staff   1.7K Jun  9 23:40 id_rsa\n\n```\n\n(Your computer should show your own username rather than `jpj`, and some usergroup besides `staff`, but the permissions string should look similar to the string all the way on the left of the above output: the `-rw-------@` portion)\n\n:::\n\n### Step 2.4: Entering the SSH Key Passphrase\n\nIf you did **not** encounter this `WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE` error, or if you encountered it but fixed it by changing the permissions on the `id_rsa` file and re-running the previous command (the `ssh` command), then the terminal should now be asking you for a **passphrase** for your **SSH private key**. In my case, this looks like:\n\n```bash\n\njpj@GSAS-AL-06LVHQQ domains % ssh -i \"id_rsa\" jpjgeorg@jpj.georgetown.domains\nEnter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': \n\n```\n\nAnd then (on Mac) it shows a tiny key icon after the `:` character (on Windows it should just show an empty black or white box). This is asking you to enter the **SSH key passphrase** that you created in step 1.2 above, **not** your general Georgetown account password that you use to access other Georgetown services like Canvas! So, start typing (or paste) that **SSH key passphrase** into the terminal.\n\nSome students have gotten worried at this point, because they notice that the **cursor does not move** as they type their passwords: **this is the expected behavior**, even though it feels weird to type and not see any feedback on the screen! It is a feature on Linux, which ensures that **even if people are watching your screen, they cannot see how long your password is** (it turns out that cracking passwords becomes much much easier, in many cases, if you know in advance **how long** the person's password is).\n\nSo, you won't see any feedback on the screen, but once you've typed or pasted your **SSH secret key passphrase**, press enter.\n\n### Step 2.5: Checking That The Connection Was Successful\n\nIf the **location of the private key file** was successfully provided to the `ssh` command via the string after the `-i` flag, and if the **private key passphrase** was entered correctly, then it should successfully connect to your Georgetown Domains server. If you have indeed successfully connected, your **terminal prompt** (the portion of the terminal where you type new commands) will suddenly **change**. Whereas before it may have looked like\n\n```bash\n\njpj@GSAS-AL-06LVHQQ ~ %\n\n```\n\nNow it should look like\n\n```bash\n\n[jpjgeorg@gtown3 ~]$ \n\n```\n\nIf you've never logged in before, it may show some additional info above this prompt, but if you have logged in before, it will also show the following above the prompt:\n\n```bash\n\nLast login: Sun Sep 10 21:47:30 2023 from 216.15.21.131\n[jpjgeorg@gtown3 ~]$\n\n```\n\nYou have now successfully connected to your Georgetown Domains server! There is one remaining step, which will help us to move from just **connecting** to the server via `ssh` to **transferring files** to/from the server via `scp` or `rsync`.\n\n### Step 2.6: Finding Your `public_html` Path\n\nOnce you have successfully connected to the server, you should also browse the directory structure to see how it works. In particular, as a first step, try just running\n\n```bash\n\npwd\n\n```\n\nThis should just show the full, absolute path to your **home directory**. In my case, the output was\n\n```bash\n\n/home/jpjgeorg\n\n```\n\nNext, run\n\n```bash\n\nls\n\n```\n\nIt should show a bunch of files and folders (probably not the same as the following output), but you should at least see a `public_html` subfolder:\n\n```bash\n\naccess-logs    dsan-conference-posters  mail           public_ftp   tmp     www\ncomposer.json  etc                      _metadata.yml  public_html  var\ncomposer.lock  logs                     perl5          ssl          vendor\n\n```\n\nThis `public_html` subfolder, within your **home** folder, is where your Georgetown Domains web server will **look for** and **serve files** when people type your **domain** (like `dsanstudent.georgetown.domains`) into their browser's address bar.\n\nSo, let's move into this `public_html` directory, by entering and executing\n\n```bash\ncd public_html\n```\n\nIf we now check our working directory, by entering and executing\n\n```bash\npwd\n```\n\n\nYou should now see something that looks like the following:\n\n```bash\n/home/jpjgeorg/public_html\n```\n\nYou should **take a screenshot** of this path, or **write it down**, or remember it some other way. Because, this is the **remote path** (the path on the remote server) that you'll want to copy your **local files** to, when we ask you e.g. to copy your `_site` directory to your Georgetown Domains server.\n\n## Step 2.7: Exiting the SSH Session and Returning to Your Local Computer\n\nNow that you know how to connect to a remote server using `ssh`, you'll have to be a bit more vigilant about noticing **which computer you're working on** when you are typing and running commands in the terminal. As mentioned above, if you see a terminal prompt that looks like the following\n\n```bash\n[jpjgeorg@gtown3 ~]$\n```\n\nThen this terminal is probably **connected to your Georgetown Domains server**, meaning that any commands you enter will be **run on the Georgetown Domains server**. If instead you see a terminal prompt that looks like\n\n```bash\njpj@GSAS-AL-06LVHQQ ~ %\n```\n\nThat means you are safely back on your local machine, so that the commands you enter will be **run locally**, on the processor of your laptop. Since we just finished an SSH session, however, we are probably **still logged in to the Georgetown Domains server**. So, to **exit** this session and return back to executing commands on your local machine, just enter and execute the `exit` command:\n\n```bash\nexit\n```\n\nIf successful, it should show output like the following:\n\n```bash\nlogout\nConnection to jpj.georgetown.domains closed.\n```\n\n## Step 3: Moving from `ssh` to `scp`\n\nNow that you know how to provide the necessary information and connect to your Georgetown Domains server using the `ssh` command, we'll move to the `scp` command. Basically, while the `ssh` command lets you connect to and **\"look around\"** inside your server, the `scp` command allows you to **transfer files** to and from your server. The information you need to provide, and the syntax, are very similar, so we're done with the hardest parts!\n\n### Step 3.1: Providing the Absolute Path to Your Private Key File (`id_rsa`)\n\nJust like the `ssh` command, you can provide a `-i` flag (short for \"identity file\"), followed by the **path** to your **ssh private key file**, as information for the `scp` command, as follows (again, don't press Enter until we're finished writing out the full command, in a later step):\n\n```bash\nscp -i \"/path/to/your/file\"\n```\n\nIn my case, since my file is located within the `/Users/jpj/` directory on my hard drive, I start the `scp` command with\n\n```bash\nscp -i \"/Users/jpj/id_rsa\"\n```\n\n### Step 3.2: Providing the Path (Absolute or Relative) to the Local File You'd Like to Copy\n\nNext, I need to give `scp` the **path** to the **file** that I'd like to copy to my Georgetown Domains server. Note that here we're starting with **file copying** rather than **folder copying**, which I **strongly recommend** so that you can check whether the syntax of your `scp` command is correct before trying to copy a ton of files. Specifically, I recommend just making a **test file** called `hello.txt`, and seeing if you can successfully use `scp` to copy this file from your local drive to your Georgetown Domains server. To create a fake file like this very quickly, you can open a **new terminal window** and run the following commands:\n\n```bash\ntouch hello.txt\necho \"Hello World\" >> hello.txt\n```\n\nWherever you run these two commands, there will now be a `hello.txt` file which contains the text `Hello World`. Now, let's try to copy this file to our Georgetown Domains server---specifically, the **`public_html` directory within our Georgetown Domains server**. To get there, we need to finish up the remaining parts of our `scp` command. Add in the **path** to the file on your **local** drive that you want to copy to the **remote server** as the next argument to `scp`, like:\n\n```bash\nscp -i \"/path/to/your/key/file\" \"hello.txt\"\n```\n\nIn this case, since I created `hello.txt` in the same directory that I am now executing the `scp` command from, I don't need to provide an absolute path (like `/Users/jpj/hello.txt`). In general, though, if you're trying to copy a file from somewhere in your computer that is **not** your current working directory, you need to include an absolute or relative path to that file here.\n\n### Step 3.3: Providing the `username@domain` String\n\nNext, we include the `username@domain` information in the exact same way we included it in the `ssh` command, making our command look like this:\n\n```bash\nscp -i \"/path/to/your/key/file\" \"hello.txt\" jpjgeorg@jpj.georgetown.domains\n```\n\n### Step 3.4: Providing the *Remote Path* Where We'd Like Our File(s) To Be Copied To\n\nThere is one last piece of information we need to provide: the **path on the remote server** where we would like to copy `hello.txt` to! In this case, we wrote it down in a previous step: it was `/home/jpjgeorg/public_html`. So, we enter this as the last piece of information in our `scp` command, but in a bit of a strange-looking way: we **add a colon (`:`)** to the end of the `username@domain` string, and then provide the desired **remote path** after this colon character. So, in this case, to transfer to the `/home/jpjgeorg/public_html` directory, we finish writing out the command as follows:\n\n```bash\nscp -i \"/path/to/your/key/file\" \"hello.txt\" jpjgeorg@jpj.georgetown.domains:/home/jpjgeorg/public_html\n```\n\n### Step 3.5: Executing the Command\n\nFinally, we can **press Enter** and execute the command! If it worked successfully, you may see a summary of the information: that it has transferred a single file, with size of only a few bytes, called `hello.txt`. Now let's check to make sure the copy actually worked\n\n### Step 3.6: Making Sure The Copy Was Successful\n\nThere are two ways you could check that this copy worked. The first, and safer way, would be to `ssh` into our remote server again, use `cd` to navigate to the `public_html` directory, and then execute `ls` and check that `hello.txt` is one of the listed files.\n\nHowever, since `public_html` is a special directory, that is **publicly-available**, we could also check that `hello.txt` transferred correctly by opening our **browser** and typing our domain followed by `/hello.txt`. So, in my case for example, you or I or anyone else could open [https://jpj.georgetown.domains/hello.txt](https://jpj.georgetown.domains/hello.txt){target=\"_blank\"}, and check to see that it indeed shows the content `Hello world!`. If your domain also shows this, when you go to (for example) `dsanstudent.georgetown.domains`, then you know that the transfer was a success!\n\n### Step 3.7: Copying Entire *Folders* Instead Of Just One File\n\nThere is only one more change you need to make to the `scp` command from above (the command which copied a file), to make it copy an entire **folder** rather than just one file. If you add an additional `-r` flag to the **very beginning** of your `ssh` command, **before** the `-i` flag, you are instructing `ssh` that it should copy the local path that you provide **recursively**. Meaning: if you now provide a path to a **folder** as the argument to `ssh` immediately after the path to your private key file (rather than a path to a **file** like we entered before), `ssh` will now recursiviely copy the folder and all of its contents to the specified remote directory.\n\nSo for example, if I had a folder called `mysite` within my home directory `/home/jpj/` on my local drive, then I could modify the previous `scp` command as follows, to copy this **folder** to my Georgetown Domains server:\n\n```bash\nscp -r -i \"/path/to/my/key/file\" \"/Users/jpj/mysite\" jpjgeorg@jpj.georgetown.domains:/home/jpjgeorg/public_html\n```\n\nThis command, once executed, should now show a series of messages, indicating the progress/completion of each file within the `mysite` folder, as it copies them one-by-one into the `/home/jpjgeorg/public_html/mysite` folder on my remote machine.\n\nOnce this command completes, you can again check that the copy was successful in one of two ways: either (a) by using `ssh` to log into the server, then using `cd` and `ls` to move to the `public_html` folder and check its contents, or (b) opening your browser and checking (in my case) [https://jpj.georgetown.domains/mysite](https://jpj.georgetown.domains/mysite){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nAs one final thing to notice: unlike in the case of `ssh`, we don't need to use `exit` to leave an `scp` \"session\". That is because, `scp` **immediately exits** from the remote server once the files have been copied. So, immediately after the `scp` command completes, you are still on your local computer, and commands that you enter and execute are still run locally (when in doubt, look for the terminal prompt! If it looks like `[jpjgeorg@gtown3 ~]$`, that means you still need to `exit` from the Georgetown Domains server back to your local machine.)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you have already created a **Georgetown Domains** account. If you haven't already done so, or you're having trouble setting one up, please feel free to <a href=\"mailto:jj1088@georgetown.edu\" target=\"_blank\">email me</a>.\n\n## Step 1: Creating a *Private Key*\n\nTo remotely access your Georgetown Domains server from your local computer (outside of the method we used before, of accessing the terminal through a web interface), you will first need to **create an SSH keypair**, which you can think of in two steps:\n\n1. Georgetown Domains generates a \"keyhole\" on your Domains server, a **Public Key**, which allows your Domains server to be accessed remotely by someone who has the matching **private key**. Hence, it also creates a\n2. **Private Key**: a file (in this case, it will be called `id_rsa`, with no file extension) that you save onto your computer, and you **remember where you saved it**, that will allow you to access your Georgetown Domains server remotely. There is a third piece of information here, which is the **passphrase** that will **protect** your private key from unauthorized usage (this is required by Georgetown, but is optional in general), but we'll worry about that in a moment.\n\nLet's generate this keypair step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1.1: Opening the \"SSH Access\" Tool in Georgetown Domains\n\nOpen your browser and navigate to the **Georgetown Domains dashboard**. This is the interface that opens if you navigate to [https://georgetown.domains/dashboard](https://georgetown.domains/dashboard){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nIf you scroll down to the category of tools with the heading \"Security\", you will see an icon and a link for \"SSH Access\":\n\n![](images/ssh_access.jpeg)\n\nClick this link to open the SSH key generation page, and then once this page opens, click the \"Manage SSH Keys\" button:\n\n![](images/manage_keys.jpeg)\n\n### Step 1.2: Generating the Key\n\nAfter clicking \"Manage SSH Keys\" and waiting for the next page to load, don't worry about any of the other options, just click the \"+ Generate a New Key\" button near the top:\n\n![](images/generate_new_key_button.jpeg)\n\nWithin the key-generation form that appears, you don't need to enter or modify anything **except for the Key Password and Reenter Password fields**. The way these two fields are phrased is a bit confusing, since you already have a **password** to access Georgetown services in general (as in, the password that you use to log into Canvas, for example, that requires Two-Factor Authentication): **do not** enter that password here. This is a **new** password, really called a **passphrase**, and all it does it **protect your SSH private key from unauthorized usage**: if someone manages to steal your `id_rsa` file, they still won't be able to access your Georgetown Domains server without knowing this **passphrase**.\n\n![](images/key_generation_form.jpeg)\n\nSo, choose a passphrase that is easy to remember and passes Georgetown's security requirements (it won't let you submit the form until the passphrase meets those requirements -- you can use the \"Password Generator\" button to auto-generate one if that's easier), and submit the form by clicking the \"Generate Key\" button at the bottom.\n\nIf all went well, you should see a success screen that says \"Key Generation Complete!\" at the top:\n\n![](images/successful_generation.jpeg)\n\nThis screen is also confusing, because it makes it seem like you need to care about the console output that it shows you underneath \"Key Generation Complete!\", but in reality you don't need to worry about it (I excluded it here just in case).\n\n### Step 1.3: Authorizing This Key to Acess Your Server\n\nFrom the \"Key Generation Complete!\" screen, click the \"Go Back\" link at the bottom of the page to return to the SSH Key Generation panel. You should see the window you saw before, with the \"+ Generate a New Key\" button at the top, but now below this button you will also see your newly-created pair of keys: the **public key** just created will now be listed in the \"Public Keys\" list, and then underneath this the **private key** just created will be listed in the \"Private Keys\" list.\n\nThe first, basic step we need to do is verify with Georgetown Domains that the public key is a valid \"keyhole\" for remote computers to use to access your Domains server (you'll notice that it is not authorized by default, so you will see the status \"not authorized\" within the \"Authorization Status\" column of the Public Keys list). To activate it, scroll to the Public Keys list and click the \"Manage\" link (with a wrench icon to the left of it):\n\n![](images/public_keys_list.jpeg)\n\nThis should bring up a screen where you can straightforwardly click the \"Authorize\" button to authorize this public key:\n\n![](images/authorize_public_key.jpeg)\n\nAnd, once you click this, you should see a success message like the following:\n\n![](images/public_key_authorized.jpeg)\n\nClick \"Go Back\" once again to return to the SSH Key Management page.\n\n### Step 1.4: Downloading the Private Key\n\nThat is the last time we'll deal with the public key, the \"keyhole\" to your server, now that it has been authorized for use. Next, scroll further down to the Private Keys listing, where you should see your `id_rsa` private key that we generated in Step 1.2:\n\n![](images/private_keys_listing.jpeg)\n\nIn this case, we **do** want to download this key (as a file) to our local computer, since the `ssh` (and `scp` and `rsync`) command will need to use this key to **acess** your server. So, click the \"View/Download\" button (with a disk icon to the left of it). This will bring you to a scary-looking page, that contains your full private key in a big textbox. You don't need to worry about this, or about the \"Convert to PPK\" section at the bottom of the page. Just scroll to the button which allows you to **download** the key file:\n\n![](images/download_key_button.jpeg)\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Make sure that, once this file has downloaded, you **move it** to a location on your local computer that is **secure** but also **easy to locate**, since you will need to know the **absolute path** to this file, in order to **tell the `ssh` command** where to find it. For example, if I copy the key file to my home directory on a Mac, its path might be:\n\n```\n/Users/jpj/id_rsa\n```\n\nIf you're on Windows, and you move it directly onto your `C:` drive for example, then the path will instead be\n\n```\nC:\\id_rsa\n```\n\nSo, just make sure you **know this absolute path** to the `id_rsa` file, remembering that it **has no file extension**: it's not `id_rsa.txt`, or `id_rsa.pub` (that could be what the public key is called), but just `id_rsa` without extension.\n\n## Step 2: Using the *Private Key* to Access Your Georgetown Domains Server\n\nNow that you have the `id_rsa` file downloaded, in a **location that you can remember the path to** (or write down the path to), open up your **terminal** if you're on Mac or Git Bash if you're on Windows. We'll start by using the `ssh` command, with our private key (`id_rsa`) file, to connect to the server.\n\nThis order is actually somewhat important: we want to start with **`ssh`**, not `scp` or `rsync`, since the syntax for the `scp` and `rsync` commands **build upon** the syntax for the `ssh` command. So, I recommend starting with `ssh`, and working your way towards `scp` and/or `rsync`.\n\nWithin your terminal, we will now \"craft\" a correct `ssh` command (you may actually want to have a text editor open, *next to* your terminal, where you can write out commands to make sure they're correct before copying-and-pasting them into the terminal). The first part is the name of the command, `ssh`. So, right now, you should just have the following written in your terminal (don't press Enter or anything yet, we're going to press Enter once we finish writing out the command!)\n\n```bash\nssh\n```\n\nNow, we need to give to the `ssh` command the following information: (a) that we want to **use a private key to connect**, and (b) the **location** of our private key, in the form of a **path** on your local computer's drive where that key exists.\n\n### Step 2.1: Providing `ssh` the Absolute Path to the Private Key File (`id_rsa`)\n\nTo give the information (a), you add the `-i` flag right after `ssh`, separated by a space. This tells `ssh` that you are about to provide a path to a private key file (again, don't press Enter yet! I will indicate when the command is finished and ready to execute in the terminal):\n\n```bash\nssh -i\n```\n\nNext, we need to provide information (b), the actual **path** to the private key file, which you should include in **double quotes** after the `-i` character (separated by a space). So, for example, if I had moved my private key to `/Users/jpj/id_rsa`, then the command at this point would look like:\n\n```bash\nssh -i \"/Users/jpj/id_rsa\"\n```\n\nIf I was on Windows, and I had saved it directly in the root of my `C:` directory, then the command would instead look like:\n\n```bash\nssh -i \"C:\\id_rsa\"\n```\n\n### Step 2.2: Providing Your Georgetown Domains Username and Domain\n\nNow, there are two final pieces of information that we need to provide to the `ssh` command: (a) our **username** on our Georgetown Domains server, and (b) the **domain** that the Georgetown Domains system has allocated for us. To find both pieces of information, you can navigate back to the Georgetown Domains Dashboard main page: [https://georgetown.domains/dashboard](https://georgetown.domains/dashboard){target=\"_blank\"}, and look for this info box near the top of the page, on the right side of the page:\n\n![](images/gtown_domains_info.jpeg)\n\nThe only information that we need is in the **first two rows** of this info box: in my case, this shows me that:\n\n* My **username** is `jpjgeorg`, and\n* My **domain** is `jpj.georgetown.domains`\n\nThese are exactly the two pieces of information we were looking for! Moving back to the terminal, we can now complete the `ssh` command by entering this information in the form `username@domain`, separated from the end of the private key file path by a space. Using my information, the command is now\n\n```bash\nssh -i \"/path/to/private/key/file\" jpjgeorg@jpj.georgetown.domains\n```\n\n**Keep in mind that this `username@domain` portion may look strange to you**, if your username and your domain are similar/identical. For example, it may have assigned you the username `dsanstudent`, and the domain `dsanstudent.georgetown.domains`: in this case, you need to make sure to include **both pieces of information**: `dsanstudent@dsanstudent.georgetown.domains`. Long story short, the Georgetown Domains system creates a **custom server** just for you, and makes you the **only user** on this custom server, so that information gets repeated in this address: the `dsanstudent.georgetown.domains` server is created, with one user called `dsanstudent`.\n\n### Step 2.3: Running the SSH Command\n\nNow that we understand this, we can **run our command**:\n\n```bash\nssh -i \"/path/to/private/key/file\" username@domain\n```\n\nIf you don't see a scary all-caps error that looks like the following:\n\n```bash\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nPermissions for 'id_rsa' are too open.\nIt is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.\nThis private key will be ignored.\nLoad key \"id_rsa\": bad permissions\nubuntu@192.168.0.1: Permission denied (publickey).\n```\n\nthen you can jump to the next step. However, some students are getting this error. If you see this, you can fix it by doing the following:\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Fixing the `INCORRECT PRIVATE KEY PERMISSIONS` Error\"}\n\nIf you see an error that looks like the above, with `WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!` all in caps, this means that when you downloaded you private key from the browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.), it set the permissions on this file to be the \"standard\" permissions for any downloaded file, which is **not** what we want for the private key file, since this is an extremely important file that we want to keep secured. So, we'll have the **change the permissions** on this file to be as secure as possible while still allowing us to use it in the terminal.\n\nSo, open up a **new** terminal window. Using the `cd` command (along with `pwd` to see what your current working directory is), navigate to the location where your `id_rsa` file is stored. Once you have arrived at that path (you can tell by running `ls` and seeing if `id_rsa` is one of the files listed in the directory), you can use the following command to change the permissions on the `id_rsa` file to the required settings for ssh access:\n\n```bash\nchmod 600 id_rsa\n```\n\nThis tells your computer to **change the permissions** of the `id_rsa` file to the permissions code `600`, which corresponds to the case where **you** (the owner) have **read and write** permissions, but **anyone else** has **no** permissions (no read, no write, and no execute) on this file. One you've done this, to make sure it worked, you can check the permissions on the `id_rsa` file specifically by running\n\n```bash\nls -lah id_rsa\n```\n\nThis should print out a detailed listing of information on the `id_rsa` file, and should look like the following if the permissions were set correctly:\n\n```bash\n\n-rw-------@ 1 jpj  staff   1.7K Jun  9 23:40 id_rsa\n\n```\n\n(Your computer should show your own username rather than `jpj`, and some usergroup besides `staff`, but the permissions string should look similar to the string all the way on the left of the above output: the `-rw-------@` portion)\n\n:::\n\n### Step 2.4: Entering the SSH Key Passphrase\n\nIf you did **not** encounter this `WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE` error, or if you encountered it but fixed it by changing the permissions on the `id_rsa` file and re-running the previous command (the `ssh` command), then the terminal should now be asking you for a **passphrase** for your **SSH private key**. In my case, this looks like:\n\n```bash\n\njpj@GSAS-AL-06LVHQQ domains % ssh -i \"id_rsa\" jpjgeorg@jpj.georgetown.domains\nEnter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': \n\n```\n\nAnd then (on Mac) it shows a tiny key icon after the `:` character (on Windows it should just show an empty black or white box). This is asking you to enter the **SSH key passphrase** that you created in step 1.2 above, **not** your general Georgetown account password that you use to access other Georgetown services like Canvas! So, start typing (or paste) that **SSH key passphrase** into the terminal.\n\nSome students have gotten worried at this point, because they notice that the **cursor does not move** as they type their passwords: **this is the expected behavior**, even though it feels weird to type and not see any feedback on the screen! It is a feature on Linux, which ensures that **even if people are watching your screen, they cannot see how long your password is** (it turns out that cracking passwords becomes much much easier, in many cases, if you know in advance **how long** the person's password is).\n\nSo, you won't see any feedback on the screen, but once you've typed or pasted your **SSH secret key passphrase**, press enter.\n\n### Step 2.5: Checking That The Connection Was Successful\n\nIf the **location of the private key file** was successfully provided to the `ssh` command via the string after the `-i` flag, and if the **private key passphrase** was entered correctly, then it should successfully connect to your Georgetown Domains server. If you have indeed successfully connected, your **terminal prompt** (the portion of the terminal where you type new commands) will suddenly **change**. Whereas before it may have looked like\n\n```bash\n\njpj@GSAS-AL-06LVHQQ ~ %\n\n```\n\nNow it should look like\n\n```bash\n\n[jpjgeorg@gtown3 ~]$ \n\n```\n\nIf you've never logged in before, it may show some additional info above this prompt, but if you have logged in before, it will also show the following above the prompt:\n\n```bash\n\nLast login: Sun Sep 10 21:47:30 2023 from 216.15.21.131\n[jpjgeorg@gtown3 ~]$\n\n```\n\nYou have now successfully connected to your Georgetown Domains server! There is one remaining step, which will help us to move from just **connecting** to the server via `ssh` to **transferring files** to/from the server via `scp` or `rsync`.\n\n### Step 2.6: Finding Your `public_html` Path\n\nOnce you have successfully connected to the server, you should also browse the directory structure to see how it works. In particular, as a first step, try just running\n\n```bash\n\npwd\n\n```\n\nThis should just show the full, absolute path to your **home directory**. In my case, the output was\n\n```bash\n\n/home/jpjgeorg\n\n```\n\nNext, run\n\n```bash\n\nls\n\n```\n\nIt should show a bunch of files and folders (probably not the same as the following output), but you should at least see a `public_html` subfolder:\n\n```bash\n\naccess-logs    dsan-conference-posters  mail           public_ftp   tmp     www\ncomposer.json  etc                      _metadata.yml  public_html  var\ncomposer.lock  logs                     perl5          ssl          vendor\n\n```\n\nThis `public_html` subfolder, within your **home** folder, is where your Georgetown Domains web server will **look for** and **serve files** when people type your **domain** (like `dsanstudent.georgetown.domains`) into their browser's address bar.\n\nSo, let's move into this `public_html` directory, by entering and executing\n\n```bash\ncd public_html\n```\n\nIf we now check our working directory, by entering and executing\n\n```bash\npwd\n```\n\n\nYou should now see something that looks like the following:\n\n```bash\n/home/jpjgeorg/public_html\n```\n\nYou should **take a screenshot** of this path, or **write it down**, or remember it some other way. Because, this is the **remote path** (the path on the remote server) that you'll want to copy your **local files** to, when we ask you e.g. to copy your `_site` directory to your Georgetown Domains server.\n\n## Step 2.7: Exiting the SSH Session and Returning to Your Local Computer\n\nNow that you know how to connect to a remote server using `ssh`, you'll have to be a bit more vigilant about noticing **which computer you're working on** when you are typing and running commands in the terminal. As mentioned above, if you see a terminal prompt that looks like the following\n\n```bash\n[jpjgeorg@gtown3 ~]$\n```\n\nThen this terminal is probably **connected to your Georgetown Domains server**, meaning that any commands you enter will be **run on the Georgetown Domains server**. If instead you see a terminal prompt that looks like\n\n```bash\njpj@GSAS-AL-06LVHQQ ~ %\n```\n\nThat means you are safely back on your local machine, so that the commands you enter will be **run locally**, on the processor of your laptop. Since we just finished an SSH session, however, we are probably **still logged in to the Georgetown Domains server**. So, to **exit** this session and return back to executing commands on your local machine, just enter and execute the `exit` command:\n\n```bash\nexit\n```\n\nIf successful, it should show output like the following:\n\n```bash\nlogout\nConnection to jpj.georgetown.domains closed.\n```\n\n## Step 3: Moving from `ssh` to `scp`\n\nNow that you know how to provide the necessary information and connect to your Georgetown Domains server using the `ssh` command, we'll move to the `scp` command. Basically, while the `ssh` command lets you connect to and **\"look around\"** inside your server, the `scp` command allows you to **transfer files** to and from your server. The information you need to provide, and the syntax, are very similar, so we're done with the hardest parts!\n\n### Step 3.1: Providing the Absolute Path to Your Private Key File (`id_rsa`)\n\nJust like the `ssh` command, you can provide a `-i` flag (short for \"identity file\"), followed by the **path** to your **ssh private key file**, as information for the `scp` command, as follows (again, don't press Enter until we're finished writing out the full command, in a later step):\n\n```bash\nscp -i \"/path/to/your/file\"\n```\n\nIn my case, since my file is located within the `/Users/jpj/` directory on my hard drive, I start the `scp` command with\n\n```bash\nscp -i \"/Users/jpj/id_rsa\"\n```\n\n### Step 3.2: Providing the Path (Absolute or Relative) to the Local File You'd Like to Copy\n\nNext, I need to give `scp` the **path** to the **file** that I'd like to copy to my Georgetown Domains server. Note that here we're starting with **file copying** rather than **folder copying**, which I **strongly recommend** so that you can check whether the syntax of your `scp` command is correct before trying to copy a ton of files. Specifically, I recommend just making a **test file** called `hello.txt`, and seeing if you can successfully use `scp` to copy this file from your local drive to your Georgetown Domains server. To create a fake file like this very quickly, you can open a **new terminal window** and run the following commands:\n\n```bash\ntouch hello.txt\necho \"Hello World\" >> hello.txt\n```\n\nWherever you run these two commands, there will now be a `hello.txt` file which contains the text `Hello World`. Now, let's try to copy this file to our Georgetown Domains server---specifically, the **`public_html` directory within our Georgetown Domains server**. To get there, we need to finish up the remaining parts of our `scp` command. Add in the **path** to the file on your **local** drive that you want to copy to the **remote server** as the next argument to `scp`, like:\n\n```bash\nscp -i \"/path/to/your/key/file\" \"hello.txt\"\n```\n\nIn this case, since I created `hello.txt` in the same directory that I am now executing the `scp` command from, I don't need to provide an absolute path (like `/Users/jpj/hello.txt`). In general, though, if you're trying to copy a file from somewhere in your computer that is **not** your current working directory, you need to include an absolute or relative path to that file here.\n\n### Step 3.3: Providing the `username@domain` String\n\nNext, we include the `username@domain` information in the exact same way we included it in the `ssh` command, making our command look like this:\n\n```bash\nscp -i \"/path/to/your/key/file\" \"hello.txt\" jpjgeorg@jpj.georgetown.domains\n```\n\n### Step 3.4: Providing the *Remote Path* Where We'd Like Our File(s) To Be Copied To\n\nThere is one last piece of information we need to provide: the **path on the remote server** where we would like to copy `hello.txt` to! In this case, we wrote it down in a previous step: it was `/home/jpjgeorg/public_html`. So, we enter this as the last piece of information in our `scp` command, but in a bit of a strange-looking way: we **add a colon (`:`)** to the end of the `username@domain` string, and then provide the desired **remote path** after this colon character. So, in this case, to transfer to the `/home/jpjgeorg/public_html` directory, we finish writing out the command as follows:\n\n```bash\nscp -i \"/path/to/your/key/file\" \"hello.txt\" jpjgeorg@jpj.georgetown.domains:/home/jpjgeorg/public_html\n```\n\n### Step 3.5: Executing the Command\n\nFinally, we can **press Enter** and execute the command! If it worked successfully, you may see a summary of the information: that it has transferred a single file, with size of only a few bytes, called `hello.txt`. Now let's check to make sure the copy actually worked\n\n### Step 3.6: Making Sure The Copy Was Successful\n\nThere are two ways you could check that this copy worked. The first, and safer way, would be to `ssh` into our remote server again, use `cd` to navigate to the `public_html` directory, and then execute `ls` and check that `hello.txt` is one of the listed files.\n\nHowever, since `public_html` is a special directory, that is **publicly-available**, we could also check that `hello.txt` transferred correctly by opening our **browser** and typing our domain followed by `/hello.txt`. So, in my case for example, you or I or anyone else could open [https://jpj.georgetown.domains/hello.txt](https://jpj.georgetown.domains/hello.txt){target=\"_blank\"}, and check to see that it indeed shows the content `Hello world!`. If your domain also shows this, when you go to (for example) `dsanstudent.georgetown.domains`, then you know that the transfer was a success!\n\n### Step 3.7: Copying Entire *Folders* Instead Of Just One File\n\nThere is only one more change you need to make to the `scp` command from above (the command which copied a file), to make it copy an entire **folder** rather than just one file. If you add an additional `-r` flag to the **very beginning** of your `ssh` command, **before** the `-i` flag, you are instructing `ssh` that it should copy the local path that you provide **recursively**. Meaning: if you now provide a path to a **folder** as the argument to `ssh` immediately after the path to your private key file (rather than a path to a **file** like we entered before), `ssh` will now recursiviely copy the folder and all of its contents to the specified remote directory.\n\nSo for example, if I had a folder called `mysite` within my home directory `/home/jpj/` on my local drive, then I could modify the previous `scp` command as follows, to copy this **folder** to my Georgetown Domains server:\n\n```bash\nscp -r -i \"/path/to/my/key/file\" \"/Users/jpj/mysite\" jpjgeorg@jpj.georgetown.domains:/home/jpjgeorg/public_html\n```\n\nThis command, once executed, should now show a series of messages, indicating the progress/completion of each file within the `mysite` folder, as it copies them one-by-one into the `/home/jpjgeorg/public_html/mysite` folder on my remote machine.\n\nOnce this command completes, you can again check that the copy was successful in one of two ways: either (a) by using `ssh` to log into the server, then using `cd` and `ls` to move to the `public_html` folder and check its contents, or (b) opening your browser and checking (in my case) [https://jpj.georgetown.domains/mysite](https://jpj.georgetown.domains/mysite){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nAs one final thing to notice: unlike in the case of `ssh`, we don't need to use `exit` to leave an `scp` \"session\". That is because, `scp` **immediately exits** from the remote server once the files have been copied. So, immediately after the `scp` command completes, you are still on your local computer, and commands that you enter and execute are still run locally (when in doubt, look for the terminal prompt! If it looks like `[jpjgeorg@gtown3 ~]$`, that means you still need to `exit` from the Georgetown Domains server back to your local machine.)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"include-in-header":{"text":"<script
