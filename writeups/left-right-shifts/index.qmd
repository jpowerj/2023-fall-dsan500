Apropos of a question from your <a href='https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/173310/quizzes/201583/' target='_blank'>Quiz-3.2</a> assignment, the following is a quick writeup explaining why we get the strange result that, given some original function $f(x)$ and constant $c > 0$,

* $g(x) = f(x + c)$ represents a shift to the **left** by $c$ units, and
* $g(x) = f(x - c)$ represents a shift to the **right** by $c$ units.

This is a classic weird aspect of Cartesian plots (plots on the $xy$-plane) that essentially exists to cruelly trick people, by making the mathematical formulation of something the opposite of our intuition ðŸ˜‘

The way to get around this trick is to just work through it by making a table of some function $f(x)$, then a table of $g(x) = f(x + c)$ and/or $g(x) = f(x - c)$, and seeing how the table changes.

For example, let's pick $f(x) = x$ (so, just a diagonal line with a slope of 1 and a y-intercept of 0), and then to represent the case where $c = 3$, define a new function $g(x) = f(x + 3)$. Then a table of values for the plain $f(x)$ function looks like:

| $x$ | $f(x)$ |
| - | - |
| $x = -1$ | $f(-1) = -1$ |
| $x = 0$ | $f(0) = 0$ |
| $x = 1$ | $f(1) = 1$ |
| $x = 2$ | $f(2) = 2$ |
| $x = 3$ | $f(x) = 3$ |
| $x = 4$ | $f(x) = 4$ |

And now let's make a table of values for $g(x)$:

| $x$ | $g(x)$ |
| - | - |
| $x = -1$ | $g(x) = f(x + 3) = f(2) = 2$ |
| $x = 0$ | $g(x) = f(x + 3) = f(3) = 3$ |
| $x = 1$ | $g(x) = f(x + 3) = f(4) = 4$ |

So:

* The original $f(x)$ passed through the point $(4, 4)$, but our new $g(x)$ passes through the point $(1,4)$, which is **3 units to the left** of $(4, 4)$.
* The original $f(x)$ passed through the point $(3, 3)$, whereas $g(x)$ passes through the point $(0, 3)$ which is **3 units to the left**, and so on.

Basically, this weirdness comes from the way we "parametrize" functions -- in an alternative universe, we could have developed math in such a way that we'd instead define e.g. $f(x, c, d)$ to mean "$f(x)$ shifted left/right by $c$ units, up/down by $d$ units", and then we wouldn't have to worry about this weirdness.

But, thanks to Descartes, who came up with this system (hence the term "cartesian coordinates", or the "cartesian plane"), it's just $f(x + c)$, and to me there's not necessarily any better intuition besides just making the tables above and remembering that it's bizarro world, so that **adding** $c$ inside the function results in a shift to the **left**, and **subtracting** c inside the function results in a shift to the **right**.

You could trace the same logic that I'm getting at with these tables in a nicer, graphical way using e.g. <a href="https://desmos.com/" target='_blank'>Desmos</a>.

The following plots visualize what's going on, by plotting $f(x) = x$, $g(x) = f(x + 3)$, and $h(x) = f(x - 1)$, all on the same cartesian plane.
