## Data Science Fundamentals

### Filepaths

For these practice problems, assume we have a directory structure on our computer that looks as follows, and that **this is the entire directory structure** (that is, there are no additional files or folders on the computer that are not displayed in the diagram).

```{dot}
digraph G {
    rankdir="TB"
    node[shape="plaintext",fontname="Courier New"];
    "nodeRoot" [
        label=<<table>
        <tr>
          <td border="0"><b>/</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>file1.txt</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>file2.txt</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>rootImage.jpg</td>
        </tr>
        </table>>
    ];
    "nodeUsers" [
        label=<<table>
        <tr>
          <td border="0"><b>Users</b></td>
        </tr>
        </table>>
    ];
    "nodeApps" [
        label=<<table>
        <tr>
          <td border="0"><b>Applications</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>App1.app</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>App2.app</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>appImage.png</td>
        </tr>
        </table>>
    ];
    "nodeJeff" [
        label=<<table>
        <tr>
          <td border="0"><b>jpj</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>doc1.qmd</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>doc2.qmd</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>jeffImage.jpeg</td>
        </tr>
        </table>>
    ];
    nodeRoot -> nodeUsers;
    nodeRoot -> nodeApps;
    nodeUsers -> nodeJeff;
}
```

The way this diagram works is:

* The **names of folders** are bolded, and if a **folder** `X` is contained within a folder `Y`, then the diagram has an arrow between folder `X` and folder `Y`.
    * So, for example, since the **Users** folder here is a subfolder of the **/** folder (the *root folder*), there is an arrow pointing from the box with label **/** to the box with label **Users**.
* If a **file** `f` is contained within a folder, then the file is displayed as a box within the box representing the folder.
    * So, for example, since the document `doc1.qmd` is contained within the folder labeled **`jpj`**, there is a smaller box labeled `doc1.qmd` within the box labeled **`jpj`**.

Please answer the following questions, with reference to this directory structure:

1. **True** or **False**: If I am writing the document `doc1.qmd`, and I want to include the image `jeffImage.jpeg` from within the same folder, I can use the **relative path** `jeffImage.jpeg`, like

    ```
    ![Photo caption](jeffImage.jpeg)
    ```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution (Click to expand)"}

**True**: Since `jeffImage.jpeg` is in the same directory as the `.qmd` file we're authoring, we can reference it using a relative path to the file which is actually just the name of the file (since the Quarto compiler doesn't need to navigate to any other folder to retrieve the file).
:::

2. **True** or **False**: If I am writing the document `doc1.qmd`, and I want to include the image `jeffImage.jpeg` from within the same folder, I can use the **absolute path** `/Users/jpj/jeffImage.jpeg`, like

    ```
    ![Photo caption](/Users/jpj/jeffImage.jpeg)
    ```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution (Click to expand)"}

**True**: In this case, it actually doesn't matter where the `.qmd` file we're authoring exists on the filesystem, since we're using an **absolute path**. This means that, no matter where the `.qmd` file is, the Quarto compiler will be able to find the image file, by starting at the root directory `/`, navigating to the `Users` subdirectory, then the `jpj` subdirectory, and finally locating the `jeffImage.jpeg` file within this `jpj` subdirectory.
:::

3. **True** or **False**: If I am writing the document `doc1.qmd`, and I want to include the image `jeffImage.jpeg` from within the same folder, I can use the **relative path** `images/jeffImage.jpeg`, like

    ```
    ![Photo caption](images/jeffImage.jpeg)
    ```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution (Click to expand)"}

**False**: In this case, the Quarto compiler will crash with an error. It will attempt to look for an `images` subdirectory within the directory where the `.qmd` file is located, and it will not find a subdirectory called `images` (since there are no subdirectories within the `jpj` folder), producing an error.

### Python: Object-Oriented Programming (Overview)

We didn't get to talk about this much in class, so here I will give a quick overview and then a practice problem afterwards.

The way that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming' target='_blank'>Object-Oriented Programming</a> is implemented in Python is as follows:

Python provides you with a set of "default" object types: starting from the base <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object' target='_blank'>`object` class</a>, for example, it provides classes like `int`, `float`, `string`, `boolean`, and so on.

However, sometimes these base classes on their own, or combinations of them, cannot serve the purposes that you need for your particular project/application. In these cases, you can create your own **custom classes**, with syntax that looks like the following

*(**NOTE**: Despite the fact that we're not explicitly defining `Vehicle` here to be a sub-class of any other class, **by default** in Python **all classes are subclasses of the `object` class mentioned above**)*

```{python}
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, maker, num_wheels):
        self.maker = maker
        self.num_wheels = num_wheels
```

By defining the class using the line `class Vehicle` at the top, and then defining a **constructor function** called `__init__()`, we can now create new objects with the **type** `Vehicle` by using syntax like the following:

```{python}
my_vehicle = Vehicle("Toyota", 4)
```

Which will call the `__init__()` function defined above, such that now the value `"Toyota"` will be stored in the **instance variable** called `maker` within the `my_car` object, and the value `4` will be stored in the instance variable called `num_wheels` within the `my_obj` object. The **object** `my_obj` here is therefore an **instance** of the class `Vehicle`.

This means that, from this point onwards, we can access this information (the values contained in `maker` and `num_wheels`) using the **dot operator** `.` on the object, like:

```{python}
print(my_vehicle.maker, my_vehicle.num_wheels)
```

Now that we've seen how to define a **class**, providing a **template** for creating objects, and how to **create objects** using the **constructor function** within a **class**, let's now look at the notion of **inheritance**.

**An issue with OOP in *Python* (unlike many other languages) is that Python does *not* allow you to create multiple versions of the same function within the same class**.

This means, for example, that we could **not** add a `start_vehicle()` function to our `Vehicle` class which would behave differently given different input types. The following new version of `Vehicle` will produce an error:

```{python}
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, maker, num_wheels):
        self.maker = maker
        self.num_wheels = num_wheels
    
    def start_vehicle(self):
        """
        Version for cars
        """
        # Start the car

    def start_vehicle(self):
        """
        Version for motorcycles
        """
        # Start the motorcycle
```

So, if we find ourselves in a case where we want to model a **hierarchy** of more-general to more-specific versions of a class, we can use **inheritance** to define **sub-classes** of a given class which represent a more specific "version" of this class.

So, using our `Vehicle` class as our working example, we may find ourselves defining **four-wheeled** vehicles very often, since **cars** are common vehicles which always have four wheels, but also **two-wheeled** vehicles very often, since **motorcycles** are common vehicles which always have two wheels.

So, to make our lives easier, rather than having to specify the number of wheels each time we want to create an object representing a car or motorcycle, instead we can create **sub-classes** of `Vehicle` representing cars and motorcycles, as follows:

```{python}
class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, maker):
        super().__init__(maker, 4)

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, maker):
        super().__init__(maker, 2)
```

Now that we have these two sub-classes, defined in this way, we can create **`Car`** and **`Motorcycle`** objects, which will have those types (`Car` and `Motorcycle`, respectively) but will **also** both have type `Vehicle`, and will have their `num_wheels` value set automatically, without us having to provide these values explicitly to the `Car` and/or `Motorcycle` constructors:

```{python}
my_car = Car("Toyota")
my_motorcycle = Motorcycle("Kawasaki")
```

And now, despite the fact that `my_car` and `my_motorcycle` are of different sub-types, since they are both objects of type `Vehicle` we know that we can access a field called `num_wheels` on both:

```{python}
print(my_car.num_wheels, my_motorcycle.num_wheels)
```

So, we can see from this output that `num_wheels` has been set correctly, automatically, despite the fact that we did not explicitly specify the values `4` or `2` when creating our `my_car` and `my_motorcycle` objects above.

### Python: Object-Oriented Programming (Practice Problem)

Given the above overview, hopefully the following practice problem becomes more manageable!

**Fill in the blanks to make the statement correct, by choosing the correct answer from each dropdown menu**:

```{=html}
Defining a <select name="cars" id="cars" style="display: inline-block">
  <option value="answer1">class</option>
  <option value="answer2">string</option><option value="answer3">struct</option>
</select> in Python (which should include a constructor function with the name <select name="cars2" id="cars2" style="display: inline-block"><option value="answer1">__init__()</option><option value="answer2">__start__()</option><option value="answer3">__letsgooo__()</option></select>), allows us to create <b>objects</b>, each of which is <select><option value="answer1">an instance</option><option value="answer1">a version</option></select> of the class.
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution (Click to expand)"}

Defining a **class** in Python (which should include a constructor function with the name **`__init__()`**), allows us to create <b>objects</b>, each of which is **an instance** of the class.

### Typecasting: Overview

The concept of **typecasting** is one we didn't get to discuss much in class, but it's an operation that we use all the time when writing Python code: for example, every time we **print the value of an `int` or `float` variable**, we are implicitly **typecasting** the `int` or `float` to a **`string`** variable, as in the following example:

```{python}
one_plus_one = 1 + 1
print(f"One plus one is {one_plus_one}")
```

A **crucial concern with typecasting** (the main reason we worry about it as data scientists) is that we need to ensure that **the information we want to retain is indeed retained** when we perform a typecasting operation, whether implicitly or explicitly.

For example, if we make a variable called `my_pi` which we're hoping to use to represent $\pi$ to the maximum precision possible (e.g. for computing areas of circles), then we need to make sure that we never **typecast** its value to a numeric type like `int` that cannot represent the decimal precision necessary for using $\pi$:

```{python}
import math
my_pi = math.pi
print(my_pi)
my_pi = int(my_pi)
print(my_pi)
```

This may seem like a silly example, since for values like `my_pi` we would usually be aware and careful about loss of precision, but it can become more and more easy to make these types of mistakes---where typecasting leads to a **loss of information**---when you are working with a large collection of numeric variables.

More formally, we can say that **information is lost** when typecasting a variable `x` into some other type to produce a new variable `y` if it would not be possible to recover the information contained in `x` from the new variable `y`. So, given this definition,

```{python}
my_int = 3
my_str = str(my_int)
```

Would **not** be a case where information is lost, since we could always recover the original `my_int` by typecasting **back** to the `int` type;

```{python}
my_new_int = int(my_str)
print(my_new_int, my_int)
my_new_int == my_int
```

However, in the following code block

```{python}
my_float = 3.14
my_int = int(my_float)
```

We have performed a typecasting operation which has resulted in a **loss of information**, since unlike in the previous example, we are unable to re-create the original `my_float` value by typecasting `my_int` back to the `float` type:

```{python}
my_new_float = float(my_int)
print(my_float, my_new_float)
my_float == my_new_float
```

### Typecasting: Practice Problem

1. Assume we have just created a variable `my_float` using the line `my_float = 3.14`. Which of the following Python expressions represents a **typecasting** operation where **information is lost**?
    a. `my_int = int(my_float)`
    b. `my_str = str(my_float)`
    c. `my_float2 = float(my_float)`
    d. `my_float3 = np.float64(my_float)`

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution (Click to expand)"}

The correct answer is **a**: When we convert from the `float` type to the `int` type, the decimal information from the `float` is **lost**, since the resulting `int` will contain only the non-decimal information from the `float`. So, for example, `int(3.14)` produces the `int` value `3`, `int(-10.001)` produces the `int` value `-10`, and so on.

## Steps in the Data Science Pipeline

### Data Cleaning: Overview

When talking about **tabular datasets** (as in, datasets which can be represented as tables, and hence as `DataFrame`s in Pandas or `tibble`s in Tidyverse), we call a dataset:

* **Long** if the dataset contains **multiple rows** for each **unit of observation** in the data, and
* **Wide** if the dataset only contains **one row** for each **unit of observation** in the data.

For example, if the unit of observation is a **country**, then the following dataset is in **long** format, since it contains **two rows** for each country:

```{r}
#| label: long-dataset-tidyverse
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
library(tidyverse)
long_df <- table2 |> filter(
    year == 2000
) |> select(
    country, type, count
) |> rename(
    variable = type,
    value = count
)
long_df |> write_csv("assets/long_df.csv")
long_df
```

On the other hand, the following dataset (with the same unit of observation) is in **wide** format, since each country's information is contained in one and only one row.

```{r}
#| label: tidyverse-wide-df
wide_df <- table1 |> filter(
    year == 2000
) |> select(
    country, cases, population
)
wide_df |> write_csv("assets/wide_df.csv")
wide_df
```

We can use the Pandas function `pd.melt()`, however, to **convert this second dataset from wide to long format**, so it matches the format of the first dataset, as follows:

```{python}
#| label: wide-to-long-pandas
import pandas as pd
wide_df = pd.read_csv("assets/wide_df.csv")
long_df = pd.melt(
    wide_df,
    id_vars=['country'],
    value_vars=['cases','population']
)
disp(long_df)
```

### Data Cleaning: Practice Problems

1. Consider the following dataset, where the unit of observation is a **person** on a mailing list:

    | id | name | email | ip_address |
    | - | - | - | - |
    | 0 | Jimmy Fishburn | jfishburn0@ask.com | 10.14.177.175 |
    | 1 | Chadwick Arrowsmith | carrowsmith1@photobucket.com | 186.209.191.254 |
    | 2 | Antony Hartington	| ahartington2@constantcontact.com | 200.241.210.61 |

    Is this dataset in **long** or **wide** format?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution (Click to expand)"}

This dataset is in **wide** format, since the unit of observation is a **person**, and each person is represented as a **single row** in the dataset, so that each column corresponds to a property of a single person.
:::

2. Consider the following dataset, where the unit of observation is again a **person** on mailing list:

    | id | variable | value |
    | - | - | - |
    | 0 | name | Jimmy Fishburn |
    | 0 | email | `jfishburn0@ask.com` |
    | 0 | ip_address | `10.14.177.175` |
    | 1 | name | Chadwick Arrowsmith |
    | 1 | email | `carrowsmith1@photobucket.com` |
    | 1 | ip_address | `186.209.191.254` |
    | 2 | name | Antony Hartington |
    | 2 | email | `ahartington2@constantcontact.com` |
    | 2 | ip_address | 200.241.210.61 |

    Is this dataset in **long** or **wide** format?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution (Click to expand)"}

This dataset is in **long** format, since the unit of observation is a **person**, but the information we have about each person is **spread over three rows**.
:::

3. What Pandas function could we use to transform the dataset from the first problem (the wide-format dataset) into the dataset from the previous problem (the long-format dataset)?
    a. `pd.sort_values()`
    b. `pd.melt()`
    c. `pd.to_numeric()`
    d. `pd.unique()`

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Solution (Click to expand)"}

The correct answer is **a**: `pd.melt()` is the function we use to transform wide-format datasets into long-format datasets, where we supply this function with an `id_vars` parameter telling it the column which **uniquely identifies the unit of observation** in the dataset.
