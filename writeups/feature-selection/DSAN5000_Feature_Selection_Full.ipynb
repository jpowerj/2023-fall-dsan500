The plot made this a bit easier, since we could compare the areas of the two sub-rectangles within each bar, but it'd be more helpful if we could read these totals directly off of the cross-tabulation. To accomplish this, we can include the `margins=True` argument to `pd.crosstab()` and it will produce, in addition to the output above, a **totals column** and **totals row**:"

In our case, since there are more (team,season) pairs representing teams which **made the playoffs** in that season than there are (team,season) pairs representing teams which **failed** to make the playoffs, this baseline value would be derived from a function that always guesses the value `True` for our `playoffs` label.\n",

        "> **Imporant Aside: Accuracy vs. F1 Score!**<br><br>You have maybe noticed that I'm being purposefully vague about measuring **how well** a given classifier is doing: that's because, while it may feel instinctively \"right\"/natural to say \"I'll see how well my classifier is doing by measuring its **accuracy** on a task\", the notion of **accuracy** in machine learning is (sadly but truly) a **🚨RED FLAG🚨** that you should learn to be wary of! Let's quickly see why, by going over to the<br><br>**<a href='https://jjacobs.me/dsan5000/463a01339cf0f456ba54a1849df50d1a22c247e3/writeups/machine-learning/slides.html#/title-slide' target='_blank'>Extra slides on Machine Learning</a>**<br><br>that are now posted in the \"Extra Writeups\" section of the website for my sections.<br><br> Specifically, you should look at them from the beginning (they overlap, purposefully, with the slides from this week where I started talking about **Supervised** vs. **Unsupervised** learning on the liked-and-disliked-houses dataset) up to the **Measuring Errors: F1 Score** slide, which will introduce you to the **F1 Score** that we will be using here to quantify how well/not-well our random-guessing approach is doing at our task."

So, if we were doing all this as research to put into a paper and submit to a CS journal, we would now have our set of **baselines** that we should be able to **beat** in order to show that our fancier machine-learning approach was **actually *learning* something** about the data, in a deeper sense than just e.g. learning what the most-frequent label was and always guessing that.

There was an F1 score table right at the top of page 6 of the PDF.

In the case of SVM algorithms (as is discussed in the <a href='https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#tips-on-practical-use' target='_blank'>\"Tips on Practical Use\" section</a> of Scikit-learn's SVM tutorial), these models are **not scale-invariant**. This means, for example, that if you had a feature $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(5,1)$, and you decided to **center** this variable by e.g. subtracting all values by 5 to obtain $X' \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, the result of an SVM trained on $X$ is **not guaranteed to be the same** as the SVM trained on $X'$, despite the fact that these represent the exact same underlying data!\n",

        "So, to handle this undesirable property, before training an SVM we typically **normalize** all of the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (that is, we transform all values into **$z$-scores**). While we know how to do this mathematically, so that we could go through and apply the mathematical transformation to each column manually, Scikit-learn provides a nice **pipeline functionality** which can be used to ensure that this transformation is **applied automatically** before training the algorithm. So, rather than using the `clf` object we created earlier, we could replace it with a two-step **pipeline** which always transforms the data in this way before training, evaluating, or making predictions:"

        "> **Final Aside: Why Do We Have To Do This Split?**<br><br>As a quick tldr here, the reason we have to do this train-test split (at least, going one level deeper than the reason given above about the need for generalization) is because an algorithm which is **not restricted by the need to generalize** can often simply \"memorize\" every bit of information in the training data, so that if it is **evaluated** on the same data that it is **trained on**, then (with enough parameters to fit) it can always achieve a **perfect score**. And yet, despite achieving this perfect score, the algorithm will typically do **worse** than an algorithm which did **not** achieve a perfect score but was trained using a train-test split, because in the perfect-score case the algorithm is typically **overfitting**!<br><br>To see what I mean, pictorally, consider the following plots from the extra slides linked above (run the Python code cell to generate the images side-by-side):"

There are many potential reasons, but first off we can notice that we **did not check all possible subsets of our features!** The two variables we chose as our \"base\" variables may have been bad choices in this case, which constrained all of our subsequent subsets to also be bad choices for predictive subsets of the full feature space.\n",

Here, since we only have **14 features** in total, we may not need to apply such a harsh penalty until (say) the number of included features passes 7, since anything below 7 means we're cutting the number of features in half.\n",
