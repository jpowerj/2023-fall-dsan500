*(Unfortunately, for the first half of the course, I did not have all of this information collected in one place, so that it became difficult for students to find information on their presentation dates and topics. So, here I've tried to collect that info into a single table, so that hopefully this process can be less stressful for students presenting in the second half of the course!)*

The information here is loaded from a Google Sheets document, so that student names are not included in the site's html code itself (and the Sheets document will be removed at the end of the semester), but if you would like your name removed from the Sheets document for safety/security reasons please let me know.
